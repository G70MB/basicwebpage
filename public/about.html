    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As someone who considers themselves both a good and bad boy, 
    I find that I embody contrasting traits and behaviors.
     On one hand, I strive to be kind, honest, and empathetic towards others.
      I genuinely care about people's well-being and always try to lend a helping
       hand when needed. Responsibility is also important to me, as I take pride 
       in fulfilling my obligations and commitments. Additionally, I value respect
        and treat others with dignity, understanding the importance of their 
        boundaries and opinions. These qualities reflect the "good boy" within 
        me, and I believe they contribute to creating a positive impact on those around me.
</p>
<p>However, I also recognize that there is a side 
    of me that sometimes displays behaviors 
    considered less desirable. At times, I may 
    act impulsively or make choices that aren't 
    in line with my values. This "bad boy" side 
    of me can manifest in occasional moments of 
    selfishness or a disregard for the consequences 
    of my actions. While I acknowledge these shortcomings,
     I also understand that self-awareness is crucial for 
     personal growth. By reflecting on my behavior and striving 
     to make amends when necessary, I aim to learn from my mistakes 
     and develop healthier patterns of behavior over time.
